This defect is from the following issue report:
https://matsci.org/t/issues-with-combination-of-fix-move-periodic-boundary-and-kokkos/45346/8

To replicate the defect, run the following cmd using LAMMPS binary built with kokkos enabled with CUDA back end:
`lmp -pk kokkos newton on neigh half -k on g 1 -sf kk -in bug-45346.in`
Pre-computed results are stored in `cuda.log`.

To produce the OpenMP output, run the following cmd using LAMMPS binary built with kokkos enabled with OpenMP+Serial back ends:
`lmp -pk kokkos newton on neigh half -k on t 1 -sf kk -in bug-45346.in`
Pre-computed results are stored in `openmp.log`.

To check the difference in the outputs use cmd:
`diff openmp.log cuda.log`

buggy source file path in LAMMPS:
src/KOKKOS/pair_tersoff_kokkos.cpp

to check the patch run cmd:
`diff pair_tersoff_kokkos-buggy.cpp pair_tersoff_kokkos-fixed.cpp`
