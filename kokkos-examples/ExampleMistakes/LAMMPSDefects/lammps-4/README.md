This defect corresponds to the bug reported at https://github.com/lammps/lammps/issues/3535.
NOTE: reproducing this bug requires significant compute resources and time (~4-14 hrs)

To replicate the defect, run the following cmd using LAMMPS binary built with kokkos enabled with CUDA back end.
`lmp -k on g 1 -sf kk -pk kokkos newton on neigh half -in in.melting`
Pre-computed results are stored in `cuda.log`.

To produce the expected output, run the following cmd using LAMMPS binary built with kokkos enabled with OpenMP+Serial back ends:
`lmp -k on t 1 -sf kk -pk kokkos newton on neigh half -in in.melting`
Pre-computed results are stored in `openmp.log`.

To check the difference in the outputs use cmd:
`diff openmp.log cuda.log`

buggy source file path in LAMMPS:
src/KOKKOS/pair_reaxff_kokkos.cpp

to check the patch run cmd:
`diff pair_reaxff_kokkos-buggy.cpp pair_reaxff_kokkos-fixed.cpp`
