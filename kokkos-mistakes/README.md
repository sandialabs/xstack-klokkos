# Canonical Mistakes

The canonical mistakes contained here exemplify the 5 categories of programming errors initially targeted by klokkos.
When compiled defining `WITH_BUG`, each example program exhibits the corresponding defect.
Without the `WITH_BUG` definition, the example program is a correctly functioning `Kokkos` program.
Each of these examples should be minimal, in that they should only contain sufficient `Kokkos` functionality as to demonstrate the corresponding defect classification.
